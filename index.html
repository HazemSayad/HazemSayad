              <h2>What Are Some of My Thoughts?</h2>
              <p>
                I have many ideas and opinions, so here are some snippets of my
                mind:
              </p>
              <em>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Technology has proven itself to be essential in everyday's
                    life; Engineers use tools. In the yester-years, they used
                    hard tools, while in the modern era, I must use technology
                    as it is a powerful and versatile tool, just like a swiss
                    army pocket knife!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Many people confuse Experience and Knowledge. People are not
                    fully wrong, and here is why. Experience is the simple sum
                    of:
                    <strong>Knowledge + Consistency</strong>.<br /><br />
                    The beauty of
                    <strong>Knowledge</strong> is that it can be SHARED! That
                    exactly means a 100 years old man and a 15 year old boy with
                    the ability to learn, can achieve the same ammount of
                    knowledge. Which brings us to<br /><br /><strong
                      >Consistency.</strong
                    >
                    This part is so simple yet powerful as well. It is like
                    hammering a nail, sure the knowledge is common, but the
                    consistency lies in the accuracy and success rate. Though
                    this is only a matter of repetition and time to achieve a
                    comparable end result. And here is where knowledge beats
                    experience: Trying to hammer a screw!

                    So many people give up on this world, believing that it is a
                    lost cause, a failed world, or even a slowly sinking ship.
                    Well maybe. I don't seek comfort in lies to the self, and I
                    thrive on the potential to change and improving. WE can do
                    better!

                    Knowledge is power, but those in power often forget that it
                    is a responsibility, and they abuse it. Use what's in your
                    power to do good and help.

                    I love sharing knowledge, it is free, useful and often
                    helpful!
